# A-star
Pathfinding demo with A* algorithm

### A few notes
1. this project is console application.
2. simple grapgh and breadth first search
3. square grid map and breadth first search
4. square grid map with weighted edges and dijkstra search, a star search
5. I apply it to another unity project, see also [battle-city](https://github.com/zhang0xf/battle-city).
